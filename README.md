#Task Completed: Node.js Task with Authentication

Developed Node.js for the backend, with user authentication features.

Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and ensured proper validation and error handling throughout the application.

Users can register, log in, and perform authenticated actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting their data.
